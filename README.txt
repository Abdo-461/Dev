/*An express application


Componets
    Api 
    App
    flask
    
Api contains an api created by NodeJs to communicate with database CRUD functions
App contains an express app for UI in pug to communciate with the Api
Flask contains an appkication build in python and flask framework to fetch data from database and insert it into another table in the database

Time Consumed 9 days spread over 3 weeks ~~ a bit too long for such a task

Self-Evaluation
   I believe that i have took a long time to develop this application. Most of the time spent was to understand how to transfer data between node api and flask

   intial approach was to send data from node to flask
   
   better approach, use request library in python to fetch data from node api
            fetch the data in JSON format and upload it into the flask api database
            
            

The End - Happy to discuss this work*/
